## Session 3: Understanding HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) (45 mins)

- Understanding Terraform's declarative configuration language
- Defining resources, variables, and outputs in Terraform
  - Use the super hero demo
- Managing state with Terraform
  - Automatic local state
  - Manual remote state
- Variables and interpolation in HCL
  - Understanding variable types
  - Understanding variable defaults
  - Understanding variable validation
  - Understanding variable interpolation
- Understanding the locals block
- Understanding conditional expressions
- Understanding outputs
- Understanding dynamic blocks
- Modules and reusability in Terraform
- Interactive: Hands-on exercises to practice writing HCL configurations

### Hands-on exercises

1. Write an HCL block that defines a local output with the value "Hello, world!".
2. Write an HCL block that defines a local output with a value from some input. For example, if the input is "Hello", the output should be "Hello, world!".
3. Write a couple of HCL blocks that combined create a conditional output based in some input. For example, if the input is "true", the output should be "Hello, world!". If the input is "false", the output should be "Goodbye, world!".
4. Write a couple of HCL blocks that create some random outputs based on some input. Hint: Take a look at the `random_pet_name` and `random_string` resources.
5. Create an HCL locals block that calculates the sum of two variables, "num1" and "num2", and stores the result in a local variable named "sum". Use interpolation to display the value of "sum" in an output.

## Break (15 minutes)

## Session 4: Getting Started with Terraform (45 mins)

- Setting up Terraform on your machine
  - Terraform versions
- Initializing a Terraform project
- Defining and managing resources with Terraform
- Understanding Terraform state management
- Terraform AzApi provider for preview features
- Interactive: Demonstration and hands-on practice of initializing and running a Terraform project

### Hands-on exercises

1. Install Terraform.
2. Install Azure CLI.
3. Create a directory for your Terraform project.
4. Initialize your Terraform project.
5. Write an HCL block that defines an Azure resource group named "myResourceGroup" with the location set to "norwayeast".
6. Write an HCL block that creates an Azure storage account with the following properties:
   - Name: "mystorageaccount"
   - Resource group: "myResourceGroup"
   - Location: "norwayeast"
   - Account kind: "StorageV2"
   - Access tier: "Hot"
   - Replication type: "LRS"
   - Note that the storage account name needs to be globally unique. Bonus points if you find a different method than adding your own initials. Hint: look at the `random_string` resource.
7. Create an HCL variable named "vm_count" and set its value to 3. Use interpolation to define a resource block that creates an Azure virtual machine with a count equal to the value of "vm_count". Each virtual machine should have a unique name and use the same image and size.
8. Define an HCL module named "network" that takes input variables "subnet_name" and "vnet_name". Within the module, create an Azure virtual network with the provided name and a subnet with the provided name.

## Session 5: Terraform Providers (45 mins)
